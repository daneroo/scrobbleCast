## Notes

* Auth/Login: 
  * GET /users/sign_in, to get cookies (XSRF-TOKEN)
  * POST form to /users/sign_in, with authenticity_token and credentials in form  
    Note: the POST returns a 302, which rejects the request-promise,  
    whereas a faled login returns the login page content again (200)  
    the 302 response also has a new XSRF-TOKEN cookie  
* Timing concurrency
  fetchall:  20s (concurrency:{page:5,podcasts:10},rate: 500/s)
  fetchall: 715s (concurrency:{page:1,podcasts:1},rate: 1/s)
* Cron: `cron` npm module, just worked.
