      "description": "Meet the Composer is a new podcast from Q2 Music that takes listeners into the minds and creative processes of the composers making some of the most innovative, compelling and breathtakingly beautiful music today. The show is hosted by critically-acclaimed violist Nadia Sirota and funded in part by a successful Kickstarter campaign.\nAt the convergence of interview, music and production, Meet the Composer aims to show the listener who the composer is as a person, as a thinker and as an artist. The listener, in turn, gets richer context for new work than is provided by your average program note, CD liner or digital booklet, and hopefully an engaging entry point into the exciting world of New Music.\n<p><strong>Season One Schedule</strong>:</p>\n<p>Episode 1 | June 24 &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<strong>John Luther Adams</strong><br />Episode 2 | July 29 &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>Andrew Norman</strong><br />Episode 3 | August 26 &mdash;<strong>&nbsp;Donnacha Dennehy</strong><br />Episode 4 | September 30 &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>Caroline Shaw</strong><br />Episode 5 | October 28 &mdash;&nbsp;<strong>Marcos Balter</strong></p>\nThanks to New Music USA for their flexibility with the use of the \"Meet The Composer\" name, which became famous through their legacy organization founded by composer John Duffy.\n» SUBSCRIBE to the Meet the Composer podcast on iTunes\n» On-Demand Video of Meet the Composer's Launch Party and Concert in The Greene Space\n» Episode One: JOHN LUTHER ADAMS: Bad Decisions and Finding Home\n» Episode Two: ANDREW NORMAN: Better Living Through Architecture\n» Episode Three: DONNACHA DENNEHY: Composing With Frequency\n» Episode Four: CAROLINE SHAW Lives Life Beautifully\n» Episode Five: MARCOS BALTER: Failure Is an Option",
